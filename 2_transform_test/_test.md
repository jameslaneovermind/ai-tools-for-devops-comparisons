## Comparison Test #2: Transform unmanaged AWS config into Terraform code

**Objective**: To evaluate how effectively AI tools can assist in generating Terraform code from unmanaged AWS infrastructure, ensuring all resources are identified and correctly configured.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- **Discovery Completeness**: Ability to identify all existing AWS resources within an account.
- **Accuracy**: Correctly translating configurations, including inter-resource dependencies.
- **Efficiency**: Providing neatly organised and human-readable output.
- **Customisability**: Facilitating future adaptations through modular and reusable code.
